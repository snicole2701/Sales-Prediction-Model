# Sales-Prediction-Model
Using a dataset on weekly amounts spent on advertising on TV, Radio and Newspaper and the resulting sales generated from the advertisement, I created a linear regression model to determine the impact on total sales per dollar spent on each of the advertising options.
I did the linear regression model using python in Visual Studios Code

I then used Power BI to create an interactive dashboard on which the user can insert different amounts to spend on each of the advertising options and the dashboard updates to predict the total sales that will come from the advertising as well as calculate the total cost of all advertising and the total predicted sales.

The user can therefore toggle to change the amounts on each of the options and the dashboard will show the effect the changes has on the predicted sales to be made.
